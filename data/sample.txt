Welcome to the End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Demo!

This is a sample text file designed to test the encryption and decryption functionalities of your program. The file includes:
- Basic text content
- Numbers: 1234567890
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':",.<>?/\
- Newlines and indentation for format testing

Here is a quote for inspiration:
"Security is not a product, but a process." - Bruce Schneier

Testing... 1, 2, 3...
File encryption begins here. Let the magic of cryptography unfold!
